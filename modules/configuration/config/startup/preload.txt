# This file can include two sorts of things: type names and static method invocations.
# Note that comment lines (like this one) start with a # character
#
# The type names can currently be either Gosu or Java types.   They must be the fully-qualified
# name of the type. Java types listed here will simply cause the associated Class to be loaded.  
# Gosu types listed here will be parsed and compiled down to bytecode, along with all blocks and 
# inner classes of that type.  To populate the list of types, the recommended approach is to
# do whatever actions you need to via the UI, then go and visit the "Loaded Gosu Classes"
# page in the UI (under Internal Tools) and copy and paste the list here.  The next time you
# start the server, those types will be compiled on startup, which should make the initial usage
# of those actions faster.
#
# Static method invocations have the syntax type#method.  The method being referenced must be
# a static, no-arg method, and the method can be on either a Java or Gosu type.  Out of the box,
# some actions are included on the gw.api.startup.PreloadActions class.  For example, to cause all
# Gosu types to be loaded from disk, you can use:
#   gw.api.startup.PreloadActions#headerCompileAllGosuClasses
# You're free, of course, to add in your own static methods to use in this fashion. 

# Actions
# gw.api.startup.PreloadActions#headerCompileAllGosuClasses
# gw.api.startup.PreloadActions#loadAllSOAPTypeNames
# gw.api.startup.PreloadActions#loadAllPCFTypes
